The Netflix sign-in page is the entry point for existing users to access their accounts and if anyone don't have they can get started and start streaming their favorite content. It typically features a login form where users enter their registered email address or phone number and their password. Some sign-in pages may also include options for users to stay logged in or "Remember Me" on the device for convenience. Once signed in, users can enjoy seamless access to their personalized recommendations, continue watching where they left off, and explore the full range of content available on the platform.
